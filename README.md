# Saha Equation in Many-Ion Plasmas

The Saha equation is a thermodynamic realtionship between the ionisation levels of an element, their energy differences and temperature.
This equation can be used to compare the ratios of the multiple ionisation levels of given elements.

# Usage

The code runs in python and only asks for the temperature, element names, and their densities.
